## Game version
This is simplified version of Blackjack game, suitable for tabular RL methods without card counting and shuffle tracking methods <br>
Allowed actions:
- hit
- stand
<br>

Game is represented as stationary environment:
- no multiple decks
- every hand is dealt from full deck
- cards are not put aside after one action

## Algorithms

- First visit Monte carlo method
- Q learning method

## Possible improvements
- [ ] add new algorithms
- [ ] add non-stationary environment and enable card counting
